#Notes:

   Day 1: Honestly probably gonna give up on this the second i start doing any research. Right now I'm thinking about making 
   it without any library that already actually does it like QRcode or whatever. I'm going to generate the image with Pillow and
   Encode the text, url, or whatever using python. If I can successfully do all this then what it should look like it is what QRcode
   Does. That's step one and technically at that point we are down but can only improve.

   First thing is first I gotta find out how pillow works by reading the api and understanding it while messing around with some 
   Stuff.

   Day2: Ain't do shit
